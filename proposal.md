# Project Proposal: Personal Finance Tracker

**Team Members:**

- Vidushi Meel (and others if applicable)

## Project Overview

The project we are working on is a **Personal Finance Tracker**, which will allow users to manage their income, expenses, and budgets. This application will provide users with the ability to add and categorize expenses, visualize their spending habits with charts, and manage financial goals. Users will also have the option to create an account, log in securely, and access their personalized financial data from any device. The app will prioritize ease of use and simplicity, targeting individuals who want to manage their personal finances effectively.

The project will include both a frontend and a backend:

- **Frontend**: Users will interact with the application via a web-based interface built with **React** and **TypeScript**. We aim to provide a modern and responsive UI that is easy to navigate. Charts and visualizations of spending habits will be handled using **Chart.js** or a similar library.

- **Backend**: The backend will be powered by **Node.js** and **Express**, which will handle user authentication and serve as an API for managing expenses and user data. **MongoDB** will be used as the primary database to store user information, expenses, and other financial data, with **Mongoose** for schema management and interaction.

## Technologies and Libraries

We plan to use the following key technologies for this project:

- **React** for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript** for strong typing and maintainability across both frontend and backend.
- **Express.js** and **Node.js** for server-side logic and API management.
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** for data storage and schema definition.
- **Chart.js** (or similar) for visualizing data in the form of charts and graphs.
- **Vercel** for deploying the frontend and possibly **Heroku** for backend deployment (or a similar service).
- **Axios** for HTTP requests between the frontend and backend.

The project scope is realistic for the given timeframe, focusing on core functionalities such as user authentication, expense management, and data visualization, with room for potential future enhancements such as financial goal-setting and advanced analytics.
